              <h2>Britt Holley</h2>
              Age: 27
              <p>
                Years before the words Honey Boo Boo could be considered sane
                when put together in a sentence, there was Britt Holley. And for
                the last twenty years her name has rarely left our minds.
              </p>
              <p>
                It all started back in 2006 when she was the breakout star of
                Drama Mamas. The show was about a group of talented kids trying
                to break into showbiz, while focusing primarily on the immature
                antics of the kids' helicopter moms. Even though most of the
                screen time was dedicated to the constant bickering and
                backstabbing between fame-starved mothers, audiences couldn't
                deny the magnetic and charming personality of 10 year old Britt.
                Although featured cast members came and went with each season,
                Britt was the only child to be a permanent cast member for all
                five seasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2013 she reappeared on our screens, now as an 18 year old
                starring in her own series Welcome to Holleywood. This time the
                attention was solely focused on her as audiences eagerly awaited
                to see if her over-the-top personality could sustain an entire
                series. Britt didn't just eat up the spotlight, she devoured it
                as she and her wannabe actor friends redefined what it meant to
                be a reality star.
              </p>
              <p>
                From this point on the names of her shows changed based on
                whatever her current endeavor was, but she remained at the
                center of the reality-verse. From 2016-2019 Britt starred in
                Holleywooed. During that time she got engaged, married, then
                divorced to Gage Preston, the only other castmate from her
                previous series that found any sort of fame on their own.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020 she restarted her career with a new show, new network,
                and new cast. Britt traded her bourgeois friends and ex-husband
                for her family, moving them all over from Texas to LA in her
                most recent series, The Beverly Holley's. Also, for the first
                time, Britt signed a contract for her new series to air on the
                Krentler Media Channel, instead of TLC. The show had just
                finished airing its second season when Britt announced she would
                be taking part in Slashtag.

              <h2>D-Wreck</h2>
              Age: 30
              <div>
                <p>
                  D-wreck is an online personality, known for making viral prank
                  videos, and streaming video gaming content on Twitch. While
                  his real name is Derek Sarecki, he's been almost universally
                  known as D-wreck since he rose to popularity in the early
                  2000's.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He attributes his fame largely to an incident he shared on the
                  late night talk show Jimmy. He referred to himself as “the
                  ultimate latch-key kid” with a lot of free time after school
                  and a whole house to himself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  “I had a roll of quarters, a stick, and a bag full of dog poop
                  I'd found on the sidewalk. I don't remember what the original
                  plan was, I stole my parents video camera from their bedroom.
                  When I went to check the tape on the camera-- to make sure I
                  wasn't recording over something important like me opening an
                  Xbox at christmas-- I found what turned out to be my parents
                  homemade sex tape. I think most kids would see something like
                  that and be scarred for life, and don't get me wrong, I think
                  it's definitely a contributing factor to creating the monster
                  I am today. What I ended up doing was re-cutting the tape so
                  that my dads grunts sounded exactly like the beat to We Will
                  Rock You and played it at school while I sang along.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  D-wreck joked that it was a while before he got access to a
                  video camera again, but by that point there was no going back.
                  He had already had a taste of the attention gained from
                  sharing content that is equal parts distasteful and humorous,
                  and by the time he was sixteen he was one of the biggest names
                  on youtube.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By the age of 20, he started streaming himself playing games
                  online, which would frequently turn into pranks or skits that
                  often left audiences wondering if what they had just seen was
                  real or fake.
                </p>

                <p>
                  His unique brand of performance art has also landed him in
                  trouble a handful of times. The first of which was during the
                  height of the “Swatting” craze, when video gamers would call
                  in fake threats to the police against their online
                  competitors. D-wreck faked a swatting prank in which he faked
                  his own death on camera, which caused fierce backlash by both
                  the public and Law Enforcement. As penance, D-wreck submitted
                  himself to undergo 30 days of prison time. The video blogs
                  that followed only served to increase his popularity in the
                  long run, which only led to him staging increasingly
                  outlandish (and illegal) stunts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The culmination of these stunts has primed D-wreck to be the
                  ultimate wildcard for Slashtag!

              <h2>Kawaii Kiki</h2>
              Age: 24
              <div>
                <p>
                  Though her given name is Koyuki Suura, to the world she's
                  known as Kawaii Kiki. Born to Japanese immigrant parents In
                  Sydney Australia, Kiki grew up in a household that was very
                  different from the lifestyle she leads today. Little is known
                  of her childhood, aside from that she briefly had a sister,
                  who passed just before her first birthday, and that her
                  parents worked in the field of medical technology, and pushed
                  her hard to go into medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the biography page on her website, she was
                  planning to go to the University of Sydney until one fateful
                  trip to the US the summer after her senior year of high
                  school. She hadn't seriously considered following her passion
                  until her cosplay of Kerrigan from Starcraft II(with real
                  functioning wings) won the grand prize at the 2016 San Diego
                  Comic-Con Masquerade. She was offered a spot as a contestant
                  on the brand new Syfy reality competition series America's
                  Next Top Cosplayer, which would film during her first semester
                  of college.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a difficult decision to make, Kiki put college
                  indefinitely on hold to compete, and ultimately win the show.
                  From there her life became a whirlwind of paid appearances at
                  conventions, which led to sponsored cosplays from video game
                  and film producers from around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Kawaii Kiki makes as much money with her cosplays as a
                  top-tier fashion designer, and is known around the world for
                  her amazing artistry. She's participated and won Cosplay

                  According to her, she's already spent more than enough time
                  there and has no intentions of returning any time soon.

              <h2>Landon Keating</h2>
              Age: 42
              <div>
                <p>
                  Landon Keating is a TV, film, and rock star, and son of
                  Hollywood legend Great Scott Keating. Aside from a few cereal
                  commercials as a kid, Landon didn’t begin acting until he
                  starred as the voice of Gary Reptillicus III in the 1988
                  saturday morning cartoon, King of the Creepies. The show ran 8
                  seasons, during which time Landon began making live-action
                  appearances on popular family sitcoms like Packed House, Piece
                  by Piece, Family Affairs, and Kid Meets Planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the time Creepies wrapped, he was starring in high school
                  comedies and testing the waters of drama. In 1997 he played a
                  small role in the Oscar nominated film North Dakota, which
                  gave him his first taste of serious drama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late 90’s Keating was a known presence around Los
                  Angeles’ notorious Viper Room, where he met the other members
                  of what would become his band Copycat. Most of the 2000’s were
                  spent with his band, though the majority of his publicity came
                  from his frequent appearances on TMZ for his very public
                  drug-fuelled freak outs. Though his band did have some
                  success, making their way onto the billboard top 10 multiple
                  times over their three album run, they never quite hit the
                  level of stardom that Landon had experienced in acting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2011, Keating reappeared after vanishing from the public
                  eye for several years, sober and hungry for a comeback. He
                  landed the lead role of Martin Shkreli in the biopic Wu Tang
                  For One, in which he received an Oscar nomination for best
                  actor. Even though he lost the award, his career seemed to be
                  on track for a huge comeback. His return to the King of the
                  Creepies franchise only gained him more attention as he
                  returned for the live action film in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then in 2014 Murder Manion happened. Not only was the film a
                  critical and commercial flop, his bizarre over-the-top
                  performance as serial killer Arthur Wilson was heavily
                  lambasted over the internet. It seemed overnight that Landon
                  had turned from one of Hollywood's most promising comeback
                  stories to its biggest joke.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet somehow, despite having seemingly lost the respect of the
                  majority of his fans, he only continued to land bigger roles
                  in even larger box-office disasters. His followup feature, a
                  superhero movie called The Manimal, successfully killed the
                  budding Deadbolt Comics superhero franchise before it ever got
                  off the ground. Most recently, he was almost comically miscast
                  as Woody in the recent live-action adaptation of Toy Story.

              <h2>Chef Costanza</h2>

              Age: Unknown
              <div>
                <p>
                  Chef Costanza is an online cooking personality and
                  professional chef. Reporting on his biography is a challenge,
                  due to his extremely mysterious nature. Despite being one of
                  the most popular celebrity chefs out there, no one knows who
                  Chef Costanza actually is. Years before The Masked Cheerleader
                  made its way onto our screens, Costanza was wearing his
                  signature rubber mask in all of his cooking tutorials on
                  Youtube.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His channel quickly rose to fame, not just because of the
                  gimmick, but because his dishes were inventive, elevated, and
                  simple enough for a home cook to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Costanza's rise to fame was not overnight, though he did seem
                  to make the jump from Youtube talent to guest judge on Top
                  Chef fairly quickly. Costanza has remained tight-lipped on how
                  he rose to stardom so quickly, though the internet seems to be
                  divided by two theories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One group firmly believes Costanza to already be a notably
                  famous TV chef who wanted to experiment with anonymity and
                  gimmicks. If true, he's been wildly successful at it, since
                  every name has been thrown out from Guy Fieri to Paula Deen
                  with a voice modulator. Even seeing Costanza on the same
                  screen as other chefs hasn't been able to dissuade some fans,
                  insisting that editing techniques have been used to throw fans
                  off his scent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other operating theory (and the one that personally seems
                  more likely), is that Costanza is just a well-connected chef
                  who has earned a lot of respect in the cooking industry and
                  decided to wear the mask in order to avoid too much attention
                  in his personal life. Many people believe this is the case
                  especially after he explained on Graham Norton why he chose to
                  don the mask. “At first the entire goal was just to focus on
                  the food. I didn't want the audience to get distracted by who
                  was cooking it, his pedigree or background or whatever. It was
                  about the food. Of course that plan backfired massively, and
                  now I'm sitting here instead of making duck confit recipes in
                  my New York apartment.”

              <h2>Shawn Eamon</h2>
              Age: 24
              <div>
                <p>
                  Shawn Eamon is a former professional athlete. He played on the
                  New Orleans Saints from 2019-2021.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Originally from a small town near Guntersville Alabama,
                  Shawn's had football in his blood from an early age. He was
                  the only freshman in his class to play for the varsity team.
                  According to Eamon, he attributes most of his early success
                  with a natural growth spurt he had during adolescence. During
                  his senior year, his team went nearly undefeated, earning him
                  a football scholarship to the University of Alabama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While moving up to the college level definitely put him in a
                  bigger pond, he still remained a relatively big fish. He was a
                  middle linebacker, using his size and speed to make for an
                  almost impossible defense to break through. While his team did
                  not make the playoffs, he was recruited personally from the
                  team to join the NFL on the New Orleans Saints. His position
                  was demoted to outside linebacker, but he was finally in the
                  big leagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, his career was rather short lived. After the
                  Saints won the superbowl in 2021 for the second time in
                  history, the teams quarterback and MVP Danny Roth outed
                  himself and Shawn as gay partners during the postgame
                  interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The revelation was shocking to many fans, and caused an uproar
                  in the NFL community. While there have been several gay
                  players in the league, this was the first time two players on
                  the same team were actively in a relationship. During the
                  draft for the next season, Danny Roth was recruited as a first
                  pick for the San Francisco 49er's, while Shawn was overlooked
                  entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the time since, Shawn's more or less dropped off the map.
                  He appeared on several news segments on CNN and KMC, and did a
                  couple commercial spots, but aside from that he seems to be
                  living the quiet life back in his hometown in Alabama.

              <h2>Tawny Howlett</h2>
              Age: 31
              <div>
                <p>
                  Tawny Howlett is an online personality, makeup entrepreneur,
                  and lifestyle guru. She is best known for her makeup tutorial
                  videos, which she started producing in 2007 when she was only
                  17 years old.
                </p>

                <p>
                  She quickly became one of the most followed makeup
                  personalities on Youtube, and in 2011 she launched her first
                  signature makeup line through Maybe-Line. It was a huge
                  success, spawning several more lines for Maybe-Line until her
                  products grew into athletic accessories, healing crystals,
                  healthy-eating guides and more.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In 2015, she broke off from Maybe-Line when it was exposed
                  that they tested many of their cosmetics on animals. Tany
                  instead formed her own company, and manufactured all of her
                  products ethically. This gained the attention of multiple
                  wildlife protection associations like Peta, The Humane
                  Society, and Save the Giraffes. Since then Tawny has become a
                  champion for the protection of animals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In late 2022 Tawny announced that she and D-wreck were in a
                  relationship in an announcement that shocked just about
                  everyone. At first people thought it was one of D-wrecks
                  signature pranks, however the couple have been spotted
                  canoodling around LA for nearly six months now, so it would
                  seem their relationship is legit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even more shocking, in the week leading up to the premiere of
                  Slashtag, Tawny has come under fire for producing a fitness
                  drink that has left dozens of consumers with horrific food
                  poisoning. It seems the mask is slipping from the internets
                  golden girl, and I for one can't wait to see how she fares
                  inside of Slashtag.
