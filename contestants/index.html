            <h2>Britt Holley</h2>
            Age: 27
            <p>
              Years before the words Honey Boo Boo could be considered sane when
              put together in a sentence, there was Britt Holley. And for the
              last twenty years her name has rarely left our minds.
            </p>
            <p>
              It all started back in 2006 when she was the breakout star of
              Drama Mamas. The show was about a group of talented kids trying to
              break into showbiz, while focusing primarily on the immature
              antics of the kids' helicopter moms. Even though most of the
              screen time was dedicated to the constant bickering and
              backstabbing between fame-starved mothers, audiences couldn't deny
              the magnetic and charming personality of 10 year old Britt.
              Although featured cast members came and went with each season,
              Britt was the only child to be a permanent cast member for all
              five seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2013 she reappeared on our screens, now as an 18 year old
              starring in her own series Welcome to Holleywood. This time the
              attention was solely focused on her as audiences eagerly awaited
              to see if her over-the-top personality could sustain an entire
              series. Britt didn't just eat up the spotlight, she devoured it as
              she and her wannabe actor friends redefined what it meant to be a
              reality star.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this point on the names of her shows changed based on
              whatever her current endeavor was, but she remained at the center
              of the reality-verse. From 2016-2019 Britt starred in Holleywooed.
              During that time she got engaged, married, then divorced to Gage
              Preston, the only other castmate from her previous series that
              found any sort of fame on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020 she restarted her career with a new show, new network, and
              new cast. Britt traded her bourgeois friends and ex-husband for
              her family, moving them all over from Texas to LA in her most
              recent series, The Beverly Holley's. Also, for the first time,
              Britt signed a contract for her new series to air on the Krentler
              Media Channel, instead of TLC. The show had just finished airing
              its second season when Britt announced she would be taking part in
              Slashtag.

            <h2>D-Wreck</h2>
            Age: 30
            <div>
              <p>
                D-wreck is an online personality, known for making viral prank
                videos, and streaming video gaming content on Twitch. While his
                real name is Derek Sarecki, he's been almost universally known
                as D-wreck since he rose to popularity in the early 2000's.
              </p>

              <p>
                He attributes his fame largely to an incident he shared on the
                late night talk show Jimmy. He referred to himself as ‚Äúthe
                ultimate latch-key kid‚Äù with a lot of free time after school and
                a whole house to himself.
              </p>

              <p>
                ‚ÄúI had a roll of quarters, a stick, and a bag full of dog poop
                I'd found on the sidewalk. I don't remember what the original
                plan was, I stole my parents video camera from their bedroom.
                When I went to check the tape on the camera-- to make sure I
                wasn't recording over something important like me opening an
                Xbox at christmas-- I found what turned out to be my parents
                homemade sex tape. I think most kids would see something like
                that and be scarred for life, and don't get me wrong, I think
                it's definitely a contributing factor to creating the monster I
                am today. What I ended up doing was re-cutting the tape so that
                my dads grunts sounded exactly like the beat to We Will Rock You
                and played it at school while I sang along.‚Äù
              </p>

              <p>
                D-wreck joked that it was a while before he got access to a
                video camera again, but by that point there was no going back.
                He had already had a taste of the attention gained from sharing
                content that is equal parts distasteful and humorous, and by the
                time he was sixteen he was one of the biggest names on youtube.
              </p>

              <p>
                By the age of 20, he started streaming himself playing games
                online, which would frequently turn into pranks or skits that
                often left audiences wondering if what they had just seen was
                real or fake.
              </p>

              <p>
                His unique brand of performance art has also landed him in
                trouble a handful of times. The first of which was during the
                height of the ‚ÄúSwatting‚Äù craze, when video gamers would call in
                fake threats to the police against their online competitors.
                D-wreck faked a swatting prank in which he faked his own death
                on camera, which caused fierce backlash by both the public and
                Law Enforcement. As penance, D-wreck submitted himself to
                undergo 30 days of prison time. The video blogs that followed
                only served to increase his popularity in the long run, which
                only led to him staging increasingly outlandish (and illegal)
                stunts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The culmination of these stunts has primed D-wreck to be the
                ultimate wildcard for Slashtag!

            Age: 24
            <div>
              <p>
                Though her given name is Koyuki Suura, to the world she's known
                as Kawaii Kiki. Born to Japanese immigrant parents In Sydney
                Australia, Kiki grew up in a household that was very different
                from the lifestyle she leads today. Little is known of her
                childhood, aside from that she briefly had a sister, who passed
                just before her first birthday, and that her parents worked in
                the field of medical technology, and pushed her hard to go into
                medicine.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the biography page on her website, she was planning
                to go to the University of Sydney until one fateful trip to the
                US the summer after her senior year of high school. She hadn't
                seriously considered following her passion until her cosplay of
                Kerrigan from Starcraft II(with real functioning wings) won the
                grand prize at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con Masquerade. She was
                offered a spot as a contestant on the brand new Syfy reality
                competition series America's Next Top Cosplayer, which would
                film during her first semester of college.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a difficult decision to make, Kiki put college indefinitely
                on hold to compete, and ultimately win the show. From there her
                life became a whirlwind of paid appearances at conventions,
                which led to sponsored cosplays from video game and film
                producers from around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Kawaii Kiki makes as much money with her cosplays as a
                top-tier fashion designer, and is known around the world for her
                amazing artistry. She's participated and won Cosplay contests at
                conventions around the world except for Australia. According to
                her, she's already spent more than enough time there and has no
                intentions of returning any time soon.

                Landon Keating is a TV, film, and rock star, and son of
                Hollywood legend Great Scott Keating. Aside from a few cereal
                commercials as a kid, Landon didn‚Äôt begin acting until he
                starred as the voice of Gary Reptillicus III in the 1988
                saturday morning cartoon, King of the Creepies. The show ran 8
                seasons, during which time Landon began making live-action
                appearances on popular family sitcoms like Packed House, Piece
                by Piece, Family Affairs, and Kid Meets Planet.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the time Creepies wrapped, he was starring in high school
                comedies and testing the waters of drama. In 1997 he played a
                small role in the Oscar nominated film North Dakota, which gave
                him his first taste of serious drama.

              <p>
                In the late 90‚Äôs Keating was a known presence around Los
                Angeles‚Äô notorious Viper Room, where he met the other members of
                what would become his band Copycat. Most of the 2000‚Äôs were
                spent with his band, though the majority of his publicity came
                from his frequent appearances on TMZ for his very public
                drug-fuelled freak outs. Though his band did have some success,
                making their way onto the billboard top 10 multiple times over
                their three album run, they never quite hit the level of stardom
                that Landon had experienced in acting.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2011, Keating reappeared after vanishing from the public eye
                for several years, sober and hungry for a comeback. He landed
                the lead role of Martin Shkreli in the biopic Wu Tang For One,
                in which he received an Oscar nomination for best actor. Even
                though he lost the award, his career seemed to be on track for a
                huge comeback. His return to the King of the Creepies franchise
                only gained him more attention as he returned for the live
                action film in 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then in 2014 Murder Manion happened. Not only was the film a
                critical and commercial flop, his bizarre over-the-top
                performance as serial killer Arthur Wilson was heavily lambasted
                over the internet. It seemed overnight that Landon had turned
                from one of Hollywood's most promising comeback stories to its
                biggest joke.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet somehow, despite having seemingly lost the respect of the
                majority of his fans, he only continued to land bigger roles in
                even larger box-office disasters. His followup feature, a
                superhero movie called The Manimal, successfully killed the
                budding Deadbolt Comics superhero franchise before it ever got
                off the ground. Most recently, he was almost comically miscast
                as Woody in the recent live-action adaptation of Toy Story.

            <h2>Chef Costanza</h2>

            Age: Unknown
            <div>
              <p>
                Chef Costanza is an online cooking personality and professional
                chef. Reporting on his biography is a challenge, due to his
                extremely mysterious nature. Despite being one of the most
                popular celebrity chefs out there, no one knows who Chef
                Costanza actually is. Years before The Masked Cheerleader made
                its way onto our screens, Costanza was wearing his signature
                rubber mask in all of his cooking tutorials on Youtube.
              </p>
              <p>
                His channel quickly rose to fame, not just because of the
                gimmick, but because his dishes were inventive, elevated, and
                simple enough for a home cook to follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Costanza's rise to fame was not overnight, though he did seem to
                make the jump from Youtube talent to guest judge on Top Chef
                fairly quickly. Costanza has remained tight-lipped on how he
                rose to stardom so quickly, though the internet seems to be
                divided by two theories.
              </p>
              <p>
                One group firmly believes Costanza to already be a notably
                famous TV chef who wanted to experiment with anonymity and
                gimmicks. If true, he's been wildly successful at it, since
                every name has been thrown out from Guy Fieri to Paula Deen with
                a voice modulator. Even seeing Costanza on the same screen as
                other chefs hasn't been able to dissuade some fans, insisting
                that editing techniques have been used to throw fans off his
                scent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other operating theory (and the one that personally seems
                more likely), is that Costanza is just a well-connected chef who
                has earned a lot of respect in the cooking industry and decided
                to wear the mask in order to avoid too much attention in his
                personal life. Many people believe this is the case especially
                after he explained on Graham Norton why he chose to don the
                mask. ‚ÄúAt first the entire goal was just to focus on the food. I
                didn't want the audience to get distracted by who was cooking
                it, his pedigree or background or whatever. It was about the
                food. Of course that plan backfired massively, and now I'm
                sitting here instead of making duck confit recipes in my New
                York apartment.‚Äù

            <h2>Shawn Eamon</h2>
            Age: 24
            <div>
              <p>
                Shawn Eamon is a former professional athlete. He played on the
                New Orleans Saints from 2019-2021.
              </p>

              <p>
                Originally from a small town near Guntersville Alabama, Shawn's
                had football in his blood from an early age. He was the only
                freshman in his class to play for the varsity team. According to
                Eamon, he attributes most of his early success with a natural
                growth spurt he had during adolescence. During his senior year,
                his team went nearly undefeated, earning him a football
                scholarship to the University of Alabama.
              </p>
              <p>
                While moving up to the college level definitely put him in a
                bigger pond, he still remained a relatively big fish. He was a
                middle linebacker, using his size and speed to make for an
                almost impossible defense to break through. While his team did
                not make the playoffs, he was recruited personally from the team
                to join the NFL on the New Orleans Saints. His position was
                demoted to outside linebacker, but he was finally in the big
                leagues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, his career was rather short lived. After the
                Saints won the superbowl in 2021 for the second time in history,
                the teams quarterback and MVP Danny Roth outed himself and Shawn
                as gay partners during the postgame interviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                The revelation was shocking to many fans, and caused an uproar
                in the NFL community. While there have been several gay players
                in the league, this was the first time two players on the same
                team were actively in a relationship. During the draft for the
                next season, Danny Roth was recruited as a first pick for the
                San Francisco 49er's, while Shawn was overlooked entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the time since, Shawn's more or less dropped off the map. He
                appeared on several news segments on CNN and KMC, and did a
                couple commercial spots, but aside from that he seems to be
                living the quiet life back in his hometown in Alabama.

            <h2>Tawny Howlett</h2>
            Age: 31
            <div>
              <p>
                Tawny Howlett is an online personality, makeup entrepreneur, and
                lifestyle guru. She is best known for her makeup tutorial
                videos, which she started producing in 2007 when she was only 17
                years old.
              </p>

              <p>
                She quickly became one of the most followed makeup personalities
                on Youtube, and in 2011 she launched her first signature makeup
                line through Maybe-Line. It was a huge success, spawning several
                more lines for Maybe-Line until her products grew into athletic
                accessories, healing crystals, healthy-eating guides and more.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2015, she broke off from Maybe-Line when it was exposed that
                they tested many of their cosmetics on animals. Tany instead
                formed her own company, and manufactured all of her products
                ethically. This gained the attention of multiple wildlife
                protection associations like Peta, The Humane Society, and Save
                the Giraffes. Since then Tawny has become a champion for the
                protection of animals.
              </p>

              <p>
                In late 2022 Tawny announced that she and D-wreck were in a
                relationship in an announcement that shocked just about
                everyone. At first people thought it was one of D-wrecks
                signature pranks, however the couple have been spotted
                canoodling around LA for nearly six months now, so it would seem
                their relationship is legit.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even more shocking, in the week leading up to the premiere of
                Slashtag, Tawny has come under fire for producing a fitness
                drink that has left dozens of consumers with horrific food
                poisoning. It seems the mask is slipping from the internets
                golden girl, and I for one can't wait to see how she fares
                inside of Slashtag.
