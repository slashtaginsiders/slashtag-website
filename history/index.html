                      Home to the infamous Arthur Wilson, and the final resting
                      place of over 300 souls, the Propitius terrorized not one,
                      but two generations of Americans, and is considered to be
                      one of the most infamous buildings still standing in the
                      country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Propitius hotel began construction in 1902. However,
                      there were reportedly many delays and alterations to the
                      plans throughout construction, leading it to not be
                      completed until late 1906. The reason for this was because
                      the project was headed up by Wilson himself. Without any
                      background in architecture, he insisted on providing all
                      the floor plan documents, which changed radically,
                      sometimes even multiple times in a single day. Even more
                      curious, many of the rooms were seemingly built without a
                      given purpose, and some seemed to be sealed up altogether
                      after being completed. It's also well documented that
                      Arthur had secret rooms and tunnels hidden throughout the
                      building. Because of the sheer volume of different floor
                      plans, and Arthur's penchant for secrecy, it's hard to
                      find an accurate layout of the building. Below are a few
                      photos of a map that was discovered in the 1980's, and as
                      far as we know it's the closest thing to an accurate
                      layout of the Propitius.

                <p>
                  The Propitius operated from 1906 to 1928, undergoing constant
                  renovations during the entire time it existed. It was
                  initially built as a place for gold miners to spend a portion
                  of their hard-earned wealth, however when the mine dried up
                  and prohibition hit, the hotel took on a new life as a haven
                  for drunkards, gamblers, and those in search of vice. Wilson
                  converted a number of spaces in the basement into alcohol
                  distilleries, and connected them to the abandoned mining
                  tunnels under the town for distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In November of 1928, one of the distilleries in the basement
                  exploded, uncovering the skeletal remains of over a dozen
                  bodies buried underneath. Wilson fled, and was never
                  apprehended. After the incident, the hotel was shut down, and
                  the rest of the town was quickly abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Propitius, along with the rest of the town of Dire was
                  purchased by William Krentler in 1986 as a restoration
                  project. However, because of unsafe conditions, and out of
                  respect for the suspected number of bodies still on the
                  property, The Propitius was never opened to the public.

              <h2>A Brief History of Dire</h2>
              <p>
                1848-- Gold is discovered and a town sets up practically
                overnight. One remarkable feature about the mines in Dire were
                that miners didn’t have to dig particularly deep to harvest the
                ore, and instead they created a snaking series of tunnels that
                ended up sprawling just under the town itself.
              </p>

              <p>
                1855-- Dire was not only a hub of gold mining, it was also
                conveniently located between Newcastle and Alta. This made it a
                great place for people to visit while making the long trip up
                the state. While those other cities provided plenty of fruit and
                basic supplies, Dire had something that those other towns did
                not-- personality. Many of those who struck it rich during this
                time re-invested the money into the town, the most notable of
                which being John Wilson, Arthur's father.
              </p>

              <p>1906-- The Propitius finishes construction</p>

              <p>
                1910-- When the gold mines dry, Dire remains alive due to the
                train station and the entertainment. This was the height of
                Wilson’s activities expanding the hotel.
              </p>

              <p>
                1919-- The future of Dire became uncertain as Prohibition went
                into effect. Wilson, with his hotel built right on top of a
                series of spreading mines, bought up much of the town and made
                it a hub for distilleries and more, running more of the booze
                through the abandoned mines.
              </p>

              <p>
                1922-- With all other saloons and gambling halls in town run out
                of business, The Propitius stands as the single attraction in
                Dire, and the only thing keeping it alive.
              </p>

              <p>
                1928-- Wilson disappears after dozens of bodies are found after
                a distillery explosion. The town shutters almost overnight.
              </p>

              <p>
                1965-- Reverend Campbell Sutter moves into the town with his
                cult of the 8th sin, which is headquartered in the Dire Hotel.
                It’s here that he settles for nearly a year before killing off
                all of his followers, then finally himself.
              </p>

              <p>
                1986-- William Krentler Purchases the township of Dire,
                undergoing a significant restoration project

                <h2>Arthur Wilson</h2>
                <h3>1880-1928</h3>
                <p>
                  Arthur was born in 1880 to John and Martha Wilson. John was
                  originally a doctor, however he was shunned from his hometown
                  of Sacramento when he was discovered to be doing grave
                  robbings for dissection projects and moved to Dire, a mining
                  town. While he had no knack for mining, he used his life
                  savings from practicing medicine to establish a mining
                  business in town that struck huge. He decided to inject his
                  new fortune back into the town, building a saloon and gambling
                  hall along with a clinic for him to run his practice. Arthur,
                  even from a young age, was taught from his father the
                  philosophy to set his sights high.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arthur did initially have an interest in medicine, reports say
                  he wanted to be remembered for an achievement greater than his
                  fathers, so he believed that by pushing forward the
                  understanding of what caused death, and how to heal it, he
                  could make some fantastic discovery that would change the
                  world. However, his ideas were often cruel, torturous, and
                  over time it seems he became much more fascinated in causes of
                  death, rather than how to prevent it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Combined with his fascination with medical experimentation on
                  both human and animal bodies, Arthur learned how to watch for
                  a moment of hopelessness in people and capitalize on it. In a
                  recovered journal entry from 1900 he wrote that he would wait
                  until his hotel patrons were completely penniless, then
                  convince them that he had found a vein of gold just outside of
                  town. Once in a mine, he would club them over the head and tie
                  them up, sometimes torturing them for days before killing
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1902, when he was twenty two, Arthur pitched to his father
                  the idea of building a hotel the likes of which no one had
                  seen before. It would be a massive building that would become
                  the center of the town and become a draw in and of itself.
                  While John would retain ownership, he gave his son total
                  control of the project. Arthur got to work planning out a
                  multi-story hotel that not only had every modern convenience,
                  but also built a series of trapdoors and hidden rooms for him
                  to torture and kill people as his fixation on death and murder
                  grew. To counter the negative context of having a town called
                  Dire, he decided to name his establishment The Propitious, as
                  a monument to hope. On Novermber sixteenth, 1906, The
                  Propitius Hotel opened its doors to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The hotel was an immediate success. It quickly expanded,
                  opening up an apothecary for tonics, and in the basement
                  Arthur built a larger medical center for his Father’s medical
                  practice. While the gesture could have been one of kindness,
                  it's much more likely he used it as an opportunity to get
                  easier access to dead bodies to experiment on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1918, John Wilson disappeared. There is no evidence on
                  record regarding this, but it is assumed that Arthur killed
                  him. Upon his death, Arthur inherited the Propitius, along
                  with several businesses in town including a barber shop, a
                  mining provisions store, and a gambling hall. He shut them all
                  down and relocated the businesses to the Propitius. Arthur was
                  known to frequently check in with guests during shaves, or
                  when playing cards. At the time people believed him to be a
                  caring owner, making sure his guests were well served. In
                  hindsight it seems this was likely how he found targets. By
                  making his hotel the hub of the town he could easily learn who
                  was poor, alone, or getting ready to leave town. It would have
                  made for an excellent way to find victims without arousing
                  suspicion. Additionally, Arthur took on his fathers duties as
                  the town doctor, opening himself up to even more potential
                  victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once prohibition hit in 1919, he realized he had a great
                  opportunity to bring a whole new generation of victims into
                  the community. Because Arthur had so many underground tunnels,
                  he set up a distillery in one of the basements of the hotel
                  and became a booze-runner. Again he had an influx of desperate
                  drifters who would show up and work for him. No matter how bad
                  things got in the outside world, he always opportunities for
                  murder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1928, there was an explosion in one of his basement
                  distilleries, which led to the discovery of over a dozen
                  bodies. When authorities came to question Arthur, he was
                  nowhere to be found. There was an exhaustive search, but it
                  was concluded that he had somehow made a quick escape as soon
                  as the explosion happened. There is another theory that Wilson
                  was able to hide within the secret rooms and corridors of his
                  hotel, waiting out the search party until he could make his
                  escape.

                <h2>Reverend Campbell Sutter, 1960-1965</h2>
                <p>
                  After four decades away from sight, Arthur Wilson returns to
                  the public eye in 1960 in a surprising way. A priest by the
                  name of Arthur Sutter had started appearing in newspapers
                  across the country, having formed a new Christian congregation
                  known as the Church of the Eighth Sin. While he was based out
                  of Chicago, Sutter traveled all over spreading his new
                  doctrine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the budding civil rights movement, Sutter
                  preached about the sin of Defiance. He said that those who are
                  disobedient to their father are sinners. According to Sutter,
                  engaging in defiance against authority was akin to spitting in
                  God’s face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His following started small, but it grew substantially in
                  1964. Sutter called the ending of segregation an act of
                  defiance against the established rules in the government, and
                  was therefore a sin. He chastised flower children and
                  environmentalists, building a group of followers who were
                  strict and fervent believers in his extreme teachings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sutters movement was controversial, to say the least. After a
                  civil rights protestor died during one of his traveling
                  sermons in San Diego in January of 1965, Sutter revealed his
                  grand plan to his followers. He proposed that he, and 100 of
                  his most loyal followers would move to a remote location to
                  start a new colony of true believers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The followers, hand picked by Sutter, were not told where they
                  would be moving. Only to pack a suitcase of their clothes.
                  Most of these people would never be heard from again. Sutter
                  moved his congregation into the Propitious Hotel. He claimed
                  it was the perfect place for his congregation, because it was
                  a ghost town where they would only need to follow the word of
                  God, and his mouthpiece.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s largely unknown what actually took place inside the hotel
                  during this time. All recovered accounts come from a pair of
                  former members who claimed to have escaped the hotel. In their
                  story, Sutter had forced them into living like a cult-- he had
                  extreme control over their eating and sleeping habits, often
                  making them stay awake for upwards of 40 hours at a time. He
                  would separate them frequently from each other, and force them
                  to have one-on-one sessions with him. During these sessions,
                  there were reports that Sutter knew things that people had
                  only mentioned in private, which made him seem like he was
                  more than just a man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their Church services were extreme, parishioners were forced
                  to take LSD and other hallucinogens. While under the effects
                  of these drugs, Sutter would apparently claim he was Arthur
                  Wilson, and the devil gave him mind control powers that he
                  would use to force them to do bizarre and horrible things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The anonymous survivors said they fled in the middle of the
                  night with a couple of bags filled with food and water, and
                  walked for nearly a week through the California desert before
                  they found a town. It was nearly another week before
                  authorities actually inspected The Propitius, finding 99 dead
                  bodies. They had all been gassed to death, including Arthur
                  Sutter.

                <h2>The Single Arthur Argument</h2>
                <p>
                  There is no actual evidence that links Arthur Sutter to Arthur
                  Wilson. Law enforcement has never been able to find any living
                  or dead relatives of either persona to compare DNA to.
                  However, that doesn't mean there isn’t a substantial amount of
                  circumstantial evidence linking the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although they were on hallucinogenic drugs, the two escapees
                  did claim that Arthur Sutter told them himself that he was
                  Arthur Wilson.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They both used the first name Arthur, and they both killed a
                  lot of people in The Propitius.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arthur Wilson was born in 1880, making him 85 when he returned
                  to The Propitius. Arthur Sutter claimed to be 81, roughly the
                  same age as Wilson would have been.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This one I think comes the closest to being hard evidence. In
                  the two photos below, you’ll see a picture of Arthur Wilson
                  and Arthur Sutter. In each picture they have what appears to
                  be the same odd pendant. This detail was largely the basis for
                  the demonic possession storyline in Murder Mansion, and does
                  seem to be rather compelling.

                  Home to the infamous Arthur Wilson, and the final resting
                  place of over 300 souls, the Propitius terrorized not one, but
                  two generations of Americans, and is considered to be one of
                  the most infamous buildings still standing in the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Propitius hotel began construction in 1902. However, there
                  were reportedly many delays and alterations to the plans
                  throughout construction, leading it to not be completed until
                  late 1906. The reason for this was because the project was
                  headed up by Wilson himself. Without any background in
                  architecture, he insisted on providing all the floor plan
                  documents, which changed radically, sometimes even multiple
                  times in a single day. Even more curious, many of the rooms
                  were seemingly built without a given purpose, and some seemed
                  to be sealed up altogether after being completed. It’s also
                  well documented that Arthur had secret rooms and tunnels
                  hidden throughout the building. Because of the sheer volume of
                  different floor plans, and Arthur's penchant for secrecy, it's
                  hard to find an accurate layout of the building. Below are a
                  few photos of a map that was discovered in the 1980’s, and as
                  far as we know it’s the closest thing to an accurate layout of
                  the Propitius.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Propitius operated from 1906 to 1928, undergoing constant
                  renovations during the entire time it existed. It was
                  initially built as a place for gold miners to spend a portion
                  of their hard-earned wealth, however when the mine dried up
                  and prohibition hit, the hotel took on a new life as a haven
                  for drunkards, gamblers, and those in search of vice. Wilson
                  converted a number of spaces in the basement into alcohol
                  distilleries, and connected them to the abandoned mining
                  tunnels under the town for distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In November of 1928, one of the distilleries in the basement
                  exploded, uncovering the skeletal remains of over a dozen
                  bodies buried underneath. Wilson fled, and was never
                  apprehended. After the incident, the hotel was shut down, and
                  the rest of the town was quickly abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Propitius, along with the rest of the town of Dire was
                  purchased by William Krentler in 1986 as a restoration
                  project. However, because of unsafe conditions, and out of
                  respect for the suspected number of bodies still on the
                  property, The Propitius was never opened to the public.

                  <p>
                    1848-- Gold is discovered and a town sets up practically
                    overnight. One remarkable feature about the mines in Dire were
                    that miners didn’t have to dig particularly deep to harvest the
                    ore, and instead they created a snaking series of tunnels that
                    ended up sprawling just under the town itself.

                    1855-- Dire was not only a hub of gold mining, it was also
                    conveniently located between Newcastle and Alta. This made it a
                    great place for people to visit while making the long trip up
                    the state. While those other cities provided plenty of fruit and
                    basic supplies, Dire had something that those other towns did
                    not-- personality. Many of those who struck it rich during this
                    time re-invested the money into the town, the most notable of
                    which being John Wilson, Arthur's father.

                    series of spreading mines, bought up much of the town and made
                    it a hub for distilleries and more, running more of the booze
                    through the abandoned mines.

                    <h2>Arthur Wilson</h2>
                    <h3>1880-1928</h3>
                    <p>
                      Arthur was born in 1880 to John and Martha Wilson. John was
                      originally a doctor, however he was shunned from his hometown
                      of Sacramento when he was discovered to be doing grave
                      robbings for dissection projects and moved to Dire, a mining
                      town. While he had no knack for mining, he used his life
                      savings from practicing medicine to establish a mining
                      business in town that struck huge. He decided to inject his
                      new fortune back into the town, building a saloon and gambling
                      hall along with a clinic for him to run his practice. Arthur,
                      even from a young age, was taught from his father the
                      philosophy to set his sights high.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Arthur did initially have an interest in medicine, reports say
                      he wanted to be remembered for an achievement greater than his
                      fathers, so he believed that by pushing forward the
                      understanding of what caused death, and how to heal it, he
                      could make some fantastic discovery that would change the
                      world. However, his ideas were often cruel, torturous, and
                      over time it seems he became much more fascinated in causes of
                      death, rather than how to prevent it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Combined with his fascination with medical experimentation on
                      both human and animal bodies, Arthur learned how to watch for
                      a moment of hopelessness in people and capitalize on it. In a
                      recovered journal entry from 1900 he wrote that he would wait
                      until his hotel patrons were completely penniless, then
                      convince them that he had found a vein of gold just outside of
                      town. Once in a mine, he would club them over the head and tie
                      them up, sometimes torturing them for days before killing
                      them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 1902, when he was twenty two, Arthur pitched to his father
                      the idea of building a hotel the likes of which no one had
                      seen before. It would be a massive building that would become
                      the center of the town and become a draw in and of itself.
                      While John would retain ownership, he gave his son total
                      control of the project. Arthur got to work planning out a
                      multi-story hotel that not only had every modern convenience,
                      but also built a series of trapdoors and hidden rooms for him
                      to torture and kill people as his fixation on death and murder
                      grew. To counter the negative context of having a town called
                      Dire, he decided to name his establishment The Propitious, as
                      a monument to hope. On Novermber sixteenth, 1906, The
                      Propitius Hotel opened its doors to the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The hotel was an immediate success. It quickly expanded,
                      opening up an apothecary for tonics, and in the basement
                      Arthur built a larger medical center for his Father’s medical
                      practice. While the gesture could have been one of kindness,
                      it's much more likely he used it as an opportunity to get
                      easier access to dead bodies to experiment on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 1918, John Wilson disappeared. There is no evidence on
                      record regarding this, but it is assumed that Arthur killed
                      him. Upon his death, Arthur inherited the Propitius, along
                      with several businesses in town including a barber shop, a
                      mining provisions store, and a gambling hall. He shut them all
                      down and relocated the businesses to the Propitius. Arthur was
                      known to frequently check in with guests during shaves, or
                      when playing cards. At the time people believed him to be a
                      caring owner, making sure his guests were well served. In
                      hindsight it seems this was likely how he found targets. By
                      making his hotel the hub of the town he could easily learn who
                      was poor, alone, or getting ready to leave town. It would have
                      made for an excellent way to find victims without arousing
                      suspicion. Additionally, Arthur took on his fathers duties as
                      the town doctor, opening himself up to even more potential
                      victims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once prohibition hit in 1919, he realized he had a great
                      opportunity to bring a whole new generation of victims into
                      the community. Because Arthur had so many underground tunnels,
                      he set up a distillery in one of the basements of the hotel
                      and became a booze-runner. Again he had an influx of desperate
                      drifters who would show up and work for him. No matter how bad
                      things got in the outside world, he always opportunities for
                      murder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 1928, there was an explosion in one of his basement
                      distilleries, which led to the discovery of over a dozen
                      bodies. When authorities came to question Arthur, he was
                      nowhere to be found. There was an exhaustive search, but it
                      was concluded that he had somehow made a quick escape as soon
                      as the explosion happened. There is another theory that Wilson
                      was able to hide within the secret rooms and corridors of his
                      hotel, waiting out the search party until he could make his
                      escape.

                    <h2>Reverend Campbell Sutter, 1960-1965</h2>
                    <p>
                      After four decades away from sight, Arthur Wilson returns to
                      the public eye in 1960 in a surprising way. A priest by the
                      name of Arthur Sutter had started appearing in newspapers
                      across the country, having formed a new Christian congregation
                      known as the Church of the Eighth Sin. While he was based out
                      of Chicago, Sutter traveled all over spreading his new
                      doctrine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In contrast to the budding civil rights movement, Sutter
                      preached about the sin of Defiance. He said that those who are
                      disobedient to their father are sinners. According to Sutter,
                      engaging in defiance against authority was akin to spitting in
                      God’s face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      His following started small, but it grew substantially in
                      1964. Sutter called the ending of segregation an act of
                      defiance against the established rules in the government, and
                      was therefore a sin. He chastised flower children and
                      environmentalists, building a group of followers who were
                      strict and fervent believers in his extreme teachings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sutters movement was controversial, to say the least. After a
                      civil rights protestor died during one of his traveling
                      sermons in San Diego in January of 1965, Sutter revealed his
                      grand plan to his followers. He proposed that he, and 100 of
                      his most loyal followers would move to a remote location to
                      start a new colony of true believers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The followers, hand picked by Sutter, were not told where they
                      would be moving. Only to pack a suitcase of their clothes.
                      Most of these people would never be heard from again. Sutter
                      moved his congregation into the Propitious Hotel. He claimed
                      it was the perfect place for his congregation, because it was
                      a ghost town where they would only need to follow the word of
                      God, and his mouthpiece.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It’s largely unknown what actually took place inside the hotel
                      during this time. All recovered accounts come from a pair of
                      former members who claimed to have escaped the hotel. In their
                      story, Sutter had forced them into living like a cult-- he had
                      extreme control over their eating and sleeping habits, often
                      making them stay awake for upwards of 40 hours at a time. He
                      would separate them frequently from each other, and force them
                      to have one-on-one sessions with him. During these sessions,
                      there were reports that Sutter knew things that people had
                      only mentioned in private, which made him seem like he was
                      more than just a man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Their Church services were extreme, parishioners were forced
                      to take LSD and other hallucinogens. While under the effects
                      of these drugs, Sutter would apparently claim he was Arthur
                      Wilson, and the devil gave him mind control powers that he
                      would use to force them to do bizarre and horrible things.

                      The anonymous survivors said they fled in the middle of the
                      night with a couple of bags filled with food and water, and
                      walked for nearly a week through the California desert before
                      they found a town. It was nearly another week before
                      authorities actually inspected The Propitius, finding 99 dead
                      bodies. They had all been gassed to death, including Arthur
                      Sutter.

                    <h2>The Single Arthur Argument</h2>
                    <p>
                      There is no actual evidence that links Arthur Sutter to Arthur
                      Wilson. Law enforcement has never been able to find any living
                      or dead relatives of either persona to compare DNA to.
                      However, that doesn't mean there isn’t a substantial amount of
                      circumstantial evidence linking the two.

                    <p>
                      Although they were on hallucinogenic drugs, the two escapees
                      did claim that Arthur Sutter told them himself that he was
                      Arthur Wilson.

                      They both used the first name Arthur, and they both killed a

                      Arthur Wilson was born in 1880, making him 85 when he returned
                      to The Propitius. Arthur Sutter claimed to be 81, roughly the
                      same age as Wilson would have been.

                      This one I think comes the closest to being hard evidence. In
                      the two photos below, you’ll see a picture of Arthur Wilson
                      and Arthur Sutter. In each picture they have what appears to
                      be the same odd pendant. This detail was largely the basis for
                      the demonic possession storyline in Murder Mansion, and does
                      seem to be rather compelling.
