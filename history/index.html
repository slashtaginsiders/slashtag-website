                <h2>Britt Holley</h2>
                Age: 27
                <p>
                  Years before the words Honey Boo Boo could be considered sane
                  when put together in a sentence, there was Britt Holley. And for
                  the last twenty years her name has rarely left our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It all started back in 2006 when she was the breakout star of
                  Drama Mamas. The show was about a group of talented kids trying
                  to break into showbiz, while focusing primarily on the immature
                  antics of the kids' helicopter moms. Even though most of the
                  screen time was dedicated to the constant bickering and
                  backstabbing between fame-starved mothers, audiences couldn't
                  deny the magnetic and charming personality of 10 year old Britt.
                  Although featured cast members came and went with each season,
                  Britt was the only child to be a permanent cast member for all
                  five seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2013 she reappeared on our screens, now as an 18 year old
                  starring in her own series Welcome to Holleywood. This time the
                  attention was solely focused on her as audiences eagerly awaited
                  to see if her over-the-top personality could sustain an entire
                  series. Britt didn't just eat up the spotlight, she devoured it
                  as she and her wannabe actor friends redefined what it meant to
                  be a reality star.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From this point on the names of her shows changed based on
                  whatever her current endeavor was, but she remained at the
                  center of the reality-verse. From 2016-2019 Britt starred in
                  Holleywooed. During that time she got engaged, married, then
                  divorced to Gage Preston, the only other castmate from her
                  previous series that found any sort of fame on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2020 she restarted her career with a new show, new network,
                  and new cast. Britt traded her bourgeois friends and ex-husband
                  for her family, moving them all over from Texas to LA in her
                  most recent series, The Beverly Holley's. Also, for the first
                  time, Britt signed a contract for her new series to air on the
                  Krentler Media Channel, instead of TLC. The show had just
                  finished airing its second season when Britt announced she would
                  be taking part in Slashtag.

                Age: 30
                <div>
                  <p>
                    dire-history is an online personality, known for making viral prank
                    videos, and streaming video gaming content on Twitch. While
                    his real name is Derek Sarecki, he's been almost universally
                    known as dire-history since he rose to popularity in the early
                    2000's.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    He attributes his fame largely to an incident he shared on the
                    late night talk show Jimmy. He referred to himself as “the
                    ultimate latch-key kid” with a lot of free time after school
                    and a whole house to himself.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “I had a roll of quarters, a stick, and a bag full of dog poop
                    I'd found on the sidewalk. I don't remember what the original
                    plan was, I stole my parents video camera from their bedroom.
                    When I went to check the tape on the camera-- to make sure I
                    wasn't recording over something important like me opening an
                    Xbox at christmas-- I found what turned out to be my parents
                    homemade sex tape. I think most kids would see something like
                    that and be scarred for life, and don't get me wrong, I think
                    it's definitely a contributing factor to creating the monster
                    I am today. What I ended up doing was re-cutting the tape so
                    that my dads grunts sounded exactly like the beat to We Will
                    Rock You and played it at school while I sang along.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    D-wreck joked that it was a while before he got access to a
                    video camera again, but by that point there was no going back.
                    He had already had a taste of the attention gained from
                    sharing content that is equal parts distasteful and humorous,
                    and by the time he was sixteen he was one of the biggest names
                    on youtube.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    By the age of 20, he started streaming himself playing games
                    online, which would frequently turn into pranks or skits that
                    often left audiences wondering if what they had just seen was
                    real or fake.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    His unique brand of performance art has also landed him in
                    trouble a handful of times. The first of which was during the
                    height of the “Swatting” craze, when video gamers would call
                    in fake threats to the police against their online
                    competitors. D-wreck faked a swatting prank in which he faked
                    his own death on camera, which caused fierce backlash by both
                    the public and Law Enforcement. As penance, D-wreck submitted
                    himself to undergo 30 days of prison time. The video blogs
                    that followed only served to increase his popularity in the
                    long run, which only led to him staging increasingly
                    outlandish (and illegal) stunts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The culmination of these stunts has primed D-wreck to be the
                    ultimate wildcard for Slashtag!

                    Though her given name is Koyuki Suura, to the world she's
                    known as Kawaii Kiki. Born to Japanese immigrant parents In
                    Sydney Australia, Kiki grew up in a household that was very
                    different from the lifestyle she leads today. Little is known
                    of her childhood, aside from that she briefly had a sister,
                    who passed just before her first birthday, and that her
                    parents worked in the field of medical technology, and pushed
                    her hard to go into medicine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the biography page on her website, she was
                    planning to go to the University of Sydney until one fateful
                    trip to the US the summer after her senior year of high
                    school. She hadn't seriously considered following her passion
                    until her cosplay of Kerrigan from Starcraft II(with real

                    From there her life became a whirlwind of paid appearances at
                    conventions, which led to sponsored cosplays from video game
                    and film producers from around the world.

                    Today, Kawaii Kiki makes as much money with her cosplays as a

                    her amazing artistry. She's participated and won Cosplay
                    contests at conventions around the world except for Australia.
                    According to her, she's already spent more than enough time
                    there and has no intentions of returning any time soon.

                <h2>Landon Keating</h2>
                Age: 42
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Landon Keating is a TV, film, and rock star, and son of
                    Hollywood legend Great Scott Keating. Aside from a few cereal
                    commercials as a kid, Landon didn’t begin acting until he
                    starred as the voice of Gary Reptillicus III in the 1988
                    saturday morning cartoon, King of the Creepies. The show ran 8
                    seasons, during which time Landon began making live-action
                    appearances on popular family sitcoms like Packed House, Piece
                    by Piece, Family Affairs, and Kid Meets Planet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the time Creepies wrapped, he was starring in high school
                    comedies and testing the waters of drama. In 1997 he played a
                    small role in the Oscar nominated film North Dakota, which
                    gave him his first taste of serious drama.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the late 90’s Keating was a known presence around Los
                    Angeles’ notorious Viper Room, where he met the other members
                    of what would become his band Copycat. Most of the 2000’s were
                    spent with his band, though the majority of his publicity came
                    from his frequent appearances on TMZ for his very public
                    drug-fuelled freak outs. Though his band did have some
                    success, making their way onto the billboard top 10 multiple
                    times over their three album run, they never quite hit the
                    level of stardom that Landon had experienced in acting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2011, Keating reappeared after vanishing from the public
                    eye for several years, sober and hungry for a comeback. He
                    landed the lead role of Martin Shkreli in the biopic Wu Tang
                    For One, in which he received an Oscar nomination for best
                    actor. Even though he lost the award, his career seemed to be
                    on track for a huge comeback. His return to the King of the
                    Creepies franchise only gained him more attention as he
                    returned for the live action film in 2013.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then in 2014 Murder Manion happened. Not only was the film a
                    critical and commercial flop, his bizarre over-the-top
                    performance as serial killer Arthur Wilson was heavily
                    lambasted over the internet. It seemed overnight that Landon
                    had turned from one of Hollywood's most promising comeback
                    stories to its biggest joke.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet somehow, despite having seemingly lost the respect of the
                    majority of his fans, he only continued to land bigger roles
                    in even larger box-office disasters. His followup feature, a
                    superhero movie called The Manimal, successfully killed the
                    budding Deadbolt Comics superhero franchise before it ever got
                    off the ground. Most recently, he was almost comically miscast
                    as Woody in the recent live-action adaptation of Toy Story.

                <h2>Chef Costanza</h2>

                Age: Unknown
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Chef Costanza is an online cooking personality and
                    professional chef. Reporting on his biography is a challenge,
                    due to his extremely mysterious nature. Despite being one of
                    the most popular celebrity chefs out there, no one knows who
                    Chef Costanza actually is. Years before The Masked Cheerleader
                    made its way onto our screens, Costanza was wearing his
                    signature rubber mask in all of his cooking tutorials on
                    Youtube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His channel quickly rose to fame, not just because of the
                    gimmick, but because his dishes were inventive, elevated, and
                    simple enough for a home cook to follow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Costanza's rise to fame was not overnight, though he did seem
                    to make the jump from Youtube talent to guest judge on Top
                    Chef fairly quickly. Costanza has remained tight-lipped on how
                    he rose to stardom so quickly, though the internet seems to be
                    divided by two theories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One group firmly believes Costanza to already be a notably
                    famous TV chef who wanted to experiment with anonymity and
                    gimmicks. If true, he's been wildly successful at it, since
                    every name has been thrown out from Guy Fieri to Paula Deen
                    with a voice modulator. Even seeing Costanza on the same
                    screen as other chefs hasn't been able to dissuade some fans,
                    insisting that editing techniques have been used to throw fans
                    off his scent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other operating theory (and the one that personally seems
                    more likely), is that Costanza is just a well-connected chef
                    who has earned a lot of respect in the cooking industry and
                    decided to wear the mask in order to avoid too much attention
                    in his personal life. Many people believe this is the case
                    especially after he explained on Graham Norton why he chose to
                    don the mask. “At first the entire goal was just to focus on
                    the food. I didn't want the audience to get distracted by who
                    was cooking it, his pedigree or background or whatever. It was
                    about the food. Of course that plan backfired massively, and
                    now I'm sitting here instead of making duck confit recipes in
                    my New York apartment.”

                <h2>Shawn Eamon</h2>
                Age: 24
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Shawn Eamon is a former professional athlete. He played on the
                    New Orleans Saints from 2019-2021.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Originally from a small town near Guntersville Alabama,
                    Shawn's had football in his blood from an early age. He was
                    the only freshman in his class to play for the varsity team.
                    According to Eamon, he attributes most of his early success
                    with a natural growth spurt he had during adolescence. During
                    his senior year, his team went nearly undefeated, earning him
                    a football scholarship to the University of Alabama.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While moving up to the college level definitely put him in a
                    bigger pond, he still remained a relatively big fish. He was a
                    middle linebacker, using his size and speed to make for an
                    almost impossible defense to break through. While his team did
                    not make the playoffs, he was recruited personally from the
                    team to join the NFL on the New Orleans Saints. His position
                    was demoted to outside linebacker, but he was finally in the
                    big leagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, his career was rather short lived. After the
                    Saints won the superbowl in 2021 for the second time in
                    history, the teams quarterback and MVP Danny Roth outed
                    himself and Shawn as gay partners during the postgame
                    interviews.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The revelation was shocking to many fans, and caused an uproar
                    in the NFL community. While there have been several gay
                    players in the league, this was the first time two players on
                    the same team were actively in a relationship. During the
                    draft for the next season, Danny Roth was recruited as a first
                    pick for the San Francisco 49er's, while Shawn was overlooked
                    entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the time since, Shawn's more or less dropped off the map.
                    He appeared on several news segments on CNN and KMC, and did a
                    couple commercial spots, but aside from that he seems to be
                    living the quiet life back in his hometown in Alabama.

                  <p>
                    Tawny Howlett is an online personality, makeup entrepreneur,
                    and lifestyle guru. She is best known for her makeup tutorial
                    videos, which she started producing in 2007 when she was only
                    17 years old.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    She quickly became one of the most followed makeup
                    personalities on Youtube, and in 2011 she launched her first
                    signature makeup line through Maybe-Line. It was a huge
                    success, spawning several more lines for Maybe-Line until her
                    products grew into athletic accessories, healing crystals,
                    healthy-eating guides and more.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In 2015, she broke off from Maybe-Line when it was exposed
                    that they tested many of their cosmetics on animals. Tany
                    instead formed her own company, and manufactured all of her
                    products ethically. This gained the attention of multiple
                    wildlife protection associations like Peta, The Humane
                    Society, and Save the Giraffes. Since then Tawny has become a
                    champion for the protection of animals.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In late 2022 Tawny announced that she and D-wreck were in a
                    relationship in an announcement that shocked just about
                    everyone. At first people thought it was one of D-wrecks
                    signature pranks, however the couple have been spotted
                    canoodling around LA for nearly six months now, so it would
                    seem their relationship is legit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Even more shocking, in the week leading up to the premiere of
                    Slashtag, Tawny has come under fire for producing a fitness
                    drink that has left dozens of consumers with horrific food
                    poisoning. It seems the mask is slipping from the internets
                    golden girl, and I for one can't wait to see how she fares
                    inside of Slashtag.

          <h2>The Propitius</h2>
          <p>
            Home to the infamous Arthur Wilson, and the final resting place of
            over 300 souls, the Propitius terrorized not one, but two
            generations of Americans, and is considered to be one of the most
            infamous buildings still standing in the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Propitius hotel began construction in 1902. However, there were
            reportedly many delays and alterations to the plans throughout
            construction, leading it to not be completed until late 1906. The
            reason for this was because the project was headed up by Wilson
            himself. Without any background in architecture, he insisted on
            providing all the floor plan documents, which changed radically,
            sometimes even multiple times in a single day. Even more curious,
            many of the rooms were seemingly built without a given purpose, and
            some seemed to be sealed up altogether after being completed. It’s
            also well documented that Arthur had secret rooms and tunnels hidden
            throughout the building. Because of the sheer volume of different
            floor plans, and Arthur's penchant for secrecy, it's hard to find an
            accurate layout of the building. Below are a few photos of a map
            that was discovered in the 1980’s, and as far as we know it’s the
            closest thing to an accurate layout of the Propitius.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Propitius operated from 1906 to 1928, undergoing constant
            renovations during the entire time it existed. It was initially
            built as a place for gold miners to spend a portion of their
            hard-earned wealth, however when the mine dried up and prohibition
            hit, the hotel took on a new life as a haven for drunkards,
            gamblers, and those in search of vice. Wilson converted a number of
            spaces in the basement into alcohol distilleries, and connected them
            to the abandoned mining tunnels under the town for distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In November of 1928, one of the distilleries in the basement
            exploded, uncovering the skeletal remains of over a dozen bodies
            buried underneath. Wilson fled, and was never apprehended. After the
            incident, the hotel was shut down, and the rest of the town was
            quickly abandoned.

          <p>
            The Propitius, along with the rest of the town of Dire was purchased
            by William Krentler in 1986 as a restoration project. However,
            because of unsafe conditions, and out of respect for the suspected
            number of bodies still on the property, The Propitius was never
            opened to the public.

          <h2>A Brief History of Dire</h2>
          <p>
            1848-- Gold is discovered and a town sets up practically overnight.
            One remarkable feature about the mines in Dire were that miners
            didn’t have to dig particularly deep to harvest the ore, and instead
            they created a snaking series of tunnels that ended up sprawling
            just under the town itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            1855-- Dire was not only a hub of gold mining, it was also
            conveniently located between Newcastle and Alta. This made it a
            great place for people to visit while making the long trip up the
            state. While those other cities provided plenty of fruit and basic
            supplies, Dire had something that those other towns did not--
            personality. Many of those who struck it rich during this time
            re-invested the money into the town, the most notable of which being
            John Wilson, Arthur's father.
          </p>

          <p>1906-- The Propitius finishes construction</p>

          <p>
            1910-- When the gold mines dry, Dire remains alive due to the train
            station and the entertainment. This was the height of Wilson’s
            activities expanding the hotel.
          </p>

          <p>
            1919-- The future of Dire became uncertain as Prohibition went into
            effect. Wilson, with his hotel built right on top of a series of
            spreading mines, bought up much of the town and made it a hub for
            distilleries and more, running more of the booze through the
            abandoned mines.
          </p>

          <p>
            1922-- With all other saloons and gambling halls in town run out of
            business, The Propitius stands as the single attraction in Dire, and
            the only thing keeping it alive.
          </p>

          <p>
            1928-- Wilson disappears after dozens of bodies are found after a
            distillery explosion. The town shutters almost overnight.
          </p>

            1965-- Reverend Campbell Sutter moves into the town with his cult of
            the 8th sin, which is headquartered in the Dire Hotel. It’s here

          <h2>Arthur Wilson 1880-1928</h2>
          <p>
            Arthur was born in 1880 to John and Martha Wilson. John was
            originally a doctor, however he was shunned from his hometown of
            Sacramento when he was discovered to be doing grave robbings for
            dissection projects and moved to Dire, a mining town. While he had
            no knack for mining, he used his life savings from practicing
            medicine to establish a mining business in town that struck huge. He
            decided to inject his new fortune back into the town, building a
            saloon and gambling hall along with a clinic for him to run his
            practice. Arthur, even from a young age, was taught from his father
            the philosophy to set his sights high.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur did initially have an interest in medicine, reports say he
            wanted to be remembered for an achievement greater than his fathers,
            so he believed that by pushing forward the understanding of what
            caused death, and how to heal it, he could make some fantastic
            discovery that would change the world. However, his ideas were often
            cruel, torturous, and over time it seems he became much more
            fascinated in causes of death, rather than how to prevent it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with his fascination with medical experimentation on both
            human and animal bodies, Arthur learned how to watch for a moment of
            hopelessness in people and capitalize on it. In a recovered journal
            entry from 1900 he wrote that he would wait until his hotel patrons
            were completely penniless, then convince them that he had found a
            vein of gold just outside of town. Once in a mine, he would club
            them over the head and tie them up, sometimes torturing them for
            days before killing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1902, when he was twenty two, Arthur pitched to his father the
            idea of building a hotel the likes of which no one had seen before.
            It would be a massive building that would become the center of the
            town and become a draw in and of itself. While John would retain
            ownership, he gave his son total control of the project. Arthur got
            to work planning out a multi-story hotel that not only had every
            modern convenience, but also built a series of trapdoors and hidden
            rooms for him to torture and kill people as his fixation on death
            and murder grew. To counter the negative context of having a town
            called Dire, he decided to name his establishment The Propitious, as
            a monument to hope. On Novermber sixteenth, 1906, The Propitius
            Hotel opened its doors to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hotel was an immediate success. It quickly expanded, opening up
            an apothecary for tonics, and in the basement Arthur built a larger
            medical center for his Father’s medical practice. While the gesture
            could have been one of kindness, it's much more likely he used it as
            an opportunity to get easier access to dead bodies to experiment on.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1918, John Wilson disappeared. There is no evidence on record
            regarding this, but it is assumed that Arthur killed him. Upon his
            death, Arthur inherited the Propitius, along with several businesses
            in town including a barber shop, a mining provisions store, and a
            gambling hall. He shut them all down and relocated the businesses to
            the Propitius. Arthur was known to frequently check in with guests
            during shaves, or when playing cards. At the time people believed
            him to be a caring owner, making sure his guests were well served.
            In hindsight it seems this was likely how he found targets. By
            making his hotel the hub of the town he could easily learn who was
            poor, alone, or getting ready to leave town. It would have made for
            an excellent way to find victims without arousing suspicion.
            Additionally, Arthur took on his fathers duties as the town doctor,
            opening himself up to even more potential victims.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once prohibition hit in 1919, he realized he had a great opportunity
            to bring a whole new generation of victims into the community.
            Because Arthur had so many underground tunnels, he set up a
            distillery in one of the basements of the hotel and became a
            booze-runner. Again he had an influx of desperate drifters who would
            show up and work for him. No matter how bad things got in the
            outside world, he always opportunities for murder.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1928, there was an explosion in one of his basement distilleries,
            which led to the discovery of over a dozen bodies. When authorities
            came to question Arthur, he was nowhere to be found. There was an
            exhaustive search, but it was concluded that he had somehow made a
            quick escape as soon as the explosion happened. There is another
            theory that Wilson was able to hide within the secret rooms and
            corridors of his hotel, waiting out the search party until he could
            make his escape.

          <h2>Reverend Campbell Sutter, 1960-1965</h2>
          <p>
            After four decades away from sight, Arthur Wilson returns to the
            public eye in 1960 in a surprising way. A priest by the name of
            Arthur Sutter had started appearing in newspapers across the
            country, having formed a new Christian congregation known as the
            Church of the Eighth Sin. While he was based out of Chicago, Sutter
            traveled all over spreading his new doctrine.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to the budding civil rights movement, Sutter preached
            about the sin of Defiance. He said that those who are disobedient to
            their father are sinners. According to Sutter, engaging in defiance
            against authority was akin to spitting in God’s face.
          </p>
          <p>
            His following started small, but it grew substantially in 1964.
            Sutter called the ending of segregation an act of defiance against
            the established rules in the government, and was therefore a sin. He
            chastised flower children and environmentalists, building a group of
            followers who were strict and fervent believers in his extreme
            teachings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sutters movement was controversial, to say the least. After a civil
            rights protestor died during one of his traveling sermons in San
            Diego in January of 1965, Sutter revealed his grand plan to his
            followers. He proposed that he, and 100 of his most loyal followers
            would move to a remote location to start a new colony of true
            believers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The followers, hand picked by Sutter, were not told where they would
            be moving. Only to pack a suitcase of their clothes. Most of these
            people would never be heard from again. Sutter moved his
            congregation into the Propitious Hotel. He claimed it was the
            perfect place for his congregation, because it was a ghost town
            where they would only need to follow the word of God, and his
            mouthpiece.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s largely unknown what actually took place inside the hotel
            during this time. All recovered accounts come from a pair of former
            members who claimed to have escaped the hotel. In their story,
            Sutter had forced them into living like a cult-- he had extreme
            control over their eating and sleeping habits, often making them
            stay awake for upwards of 40 hours at a time. He would separate them
            frequently from each other, and force them to have one-on-one
            sessions with him. During these sessions, there were reports that
            Sutter knew things that people had only mentioned in private, which
            made him seem like he was more than just a man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their Church services were extreme, parishioners were forced to take
            LSD and other hallucinogens. While under the effects of these drugs,
            Sutter would apparently claim he was Arthur Wilson, and the devil
            gave him mind control powers that he would use to force them to do
            bizarre and horrible things.
          </p>
          <p>
            The anonymous survivors said they fled in the middle of the night
            with a couple of bags filled with food and water, and walked for
            nearly a week through the California desert before they found a
            town. It was nearly another week before authorities actually
            inspected The Propitius, finding 99 dead bodies. They had all been
            gassed to death, including Arthur Sutter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>The Single Arthur Argument</h2>
          <p>
            There is no actual evidence that links Arthur Sutter to Arthur
            Wilson. Law enforcement has never been able to find any living or
            dead relatives of either persona to compare DNA to. However, that
            doesn't mean there isn’t a substantial amount of circumstantial
            evidence linking the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although they were on hallucinogenic drugs, the two escapees did
            claim that Arthur Sutter told them himself that he was Arthur
            Wilson.
          </p>
          <p>
            They both used the first name Arthur, and they both killed a lot of
            people in The Propitius.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur Wilson was born in 1880, making him 85 when he returned to
            The Propitius. Arthur Sutter claimed to be 81, roughly the same age
            as Wilson would have been.
          </p>

          <p>
            This one I think comes the closest to being hard evidence. In the
            two photos below, you’ll see a picture of Arthur Wilson and Arthur
            Sutter. In each picture they have what appears to be the same odd
            pendant. This detail was largely the basis for the demonic
            possession storyline in Murder Mansion, and does seem to be rather
            compelling.
