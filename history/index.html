        <h2>The Propitius</h2>
        <p>
          Home to the infamous Arthur Wilson, and the final resting place of
          over 300 souls, the Propitius terrorized not one, but two generations
          of Americans, and is considered to be one of the most infamous
          buildings still standing in the country.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Propitius hotel began construction in 1902. However, there were
          reportedly many delays and alterations to the plans throughout
          construction, leading it to not be completed until late 1906. The
          reason for this was because the project was headed up by Wilson
          himself. Without any background in architecture, he insisted on
          providing all the floor plan documents, which changed radically,
          sometimes even multiple times in a single day. Even more curious, many
          of the rooms were seemingly built without a given purpose, and some
          seemed to be sealed up altogether after being completed. Itâ€™s also
          well documented that Arthur had secret rooms and tunnels hidden
          throughout the building. Because of the sheer volume of different
          floor plans, and Arthur's penchant for secrecy, it's hard to find an
          accurate layout of the building. Below are a few photos of a map that
          was discovered in the 1980â€™s, and as far as we know itâ€™s the closest
          thing to an accurate layout of the Propitius.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Propitius operated from 1906 to 1928, undergoing constant
          renovations during the entire time it existed. It was initially built
          as a place for gold miners to spend a portion of their hard-earned
          wealth, however when the mine dried up and prohibition hit, the hotel
          took on a new life as a haven for drunkards, gamblers, and those in
          search of vice. Wilson converted a number of spaces in the basement
          into alcohol distilleries, and connected them to the abandoned mining
          tunnels under the town for distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November of 1928, one of the distilleries in the basement exploded,
          uncovering the skeletal remains of over a dozen bodies buried
          underneath. Wilson fled, and was never apprehended. After the
          incident, the hotel was shut down, and the rest of the town was
          quickly abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Propitius, along with the rest of the town of Dire was purchased
          by William Krentler in 1986 as a restoration project. However, because
          of unsafe conditions, and out of respect for the suspected number of
          bodies still on the property, The Propitius was never opened to the
          public.

        <h2>A Brief History of Dire</h2>
        <p>
          1848-- Gold is discovered and a town sets up practically overnight.
          One remarkable feature about the mines in Dire were that miners didnâ€™t
          have to dig particularly deep to harvest the ore, and instead they
          created a snaking series of tunnels that ended up sprawling just under
          the town itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          1855-- Dire was not only a hub of gold mining, it was also
          conveniently located between Newcastle and Alta. This made it a great
          place for people to visit while making the long trip up the state.
          While those other cities provided plenty of fruit and basic supplies,
          Dire had something that those other towns did not-- personality. Many
          of those who struck it rich during this time re-invested the money
          into the town, the most notable of which being John Wilson, Arthur's
          father.
        </p>

        <p>1906-- The Propitius finishes construction</p>

        <p>
          1910-- When the gold mines dry, Dire remains alive due to the train
          station and the entertainment. This was the height of Wilsonâ€™s
          activities expanding the hotel.
        </p>

        <p>
          1919-- The future of Dire became uncertain as Prohibition went into
          effect. Wilson, with his hotel built right on top of a series of
          spreading mines, bought up much of the town and made it a hub for
          distilleries and more, running more of the booze through the abandoned
          mines.
        </p>

        <p>
          1922-- With all other saloons and gambling halls in town run out of
          business, The Propitius stands as the single attraction in Dire, and
          the only thing keeping it alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          1928-- Wilson disappears after dozens of bodies are found after a
          distillery explosion. The town shutters almost overnight.
        </p>

        <p>
          1965-- Reverend Campbell Sutter moves into the town with his cult of
          the 8th sin, which is headquartered in the Dire Hotel. Itâ€™s here that
          he settles for nearly a year before killing off all of his followers,
          then finally himself.
        </p>

        <p>
          1986-- William Krentler Purchases the township of Dire, undergoing a
          significant restoration project

        <h2>Arthur Wilson 1880-1928</h2>
        <p>
          Arthur was born in 1880 to John and Martha Wilson. John was originally
          a doctor, however he was shunned from his hometown of Sacramento when
          he was discovered to be doing grave robbings for dissection projects
          and moved to Dire, a mining town. While he had no knack for mining, he
          used his life savings from practicing medicine to establish a mining
          business in town that struck huge. He decided to inject his new
          fortune back into the town, building a saloon and gambling hall along
          with a clinic for him to run his practice. Arthur, even from a young
          age, was taught from his father the philosophy to set his sights high.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arthur did initially have an interest in medicine, reports say he
          wanted to be remembered for an achievement greater than his fathers,
          so he believed that by pushing forward the understanding of what
          caused death, and how to heal it, he could make some fantastic
          discovery that would change the world. However, his ideas were often
          cruel, torturous, and over time it seems he became much more
          fascinated in causes of death, rather than how to prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combined with his fascination with medical experimentation on both
          human and animal bodies, Arthur learned how to watch for a moment of
          hopelessness in people and capitalize on it. In a recovered journal
          entry from 1900 he wrote that he would wait until his hotel patrons
          were completely penniless, then convince them that he had found a vein
          of gold just outside of town. Once in a mine, he would club them over
          the head and tie them up, sometimes torturing them for days before
          killing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1902, when he was twenty two, Arthur pitched to his father the idea
          of building a hotel the likes of which no one had seen before. It
          would be a massive building that would become the center of the town
          and become a draw in and of itself. While John would retain ownership,
          he gave his son total control of the project. Arthur got to work
          planning out a multi-story hotel that not only had every modern
          convenience, but also built a series of trapdoors and hidden rooms for
          him to torture and kill people as his fixation on death and murder
          grew. To counter the negative context of having a town called Dire, he
          decided to name his establishment The Propitious, as a monument to
          hope. On Novermber sixteenth, 1906, The Propitius Hotel opened its
          doors to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel was an immediate success. It quickly expanded, opening up an
          apothecary for tonics, and in the basement Arthur built a larger
          medical center for his Fatherâ€™s medical practice. While the gesture
          could have been one of kindness, it's much more likely he used it as
          an opportunity to get easier access to dead bodies to experiment on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1918, John Wilson disappeared. There is no evidence on record
          regarding this, but it is assumed that Arthur killed him. Upon his
          death, Arthur inherited the Propitius, along with several businesses
          in town including a barber shop, a mining provisions store, and a
          gambling hall. He shut them all down and relocated the businesses to
          the Propitius. Arthur was known to frequently check in with guests
          during shaves, or when playing cards. At the time people believed him
          to be a caring owner, making sure his guests were well served. In
          hindsight it seems this was likely how he found targets. By making his
          hotel the hub of the town he could easily learn who was poor, alone,
          or getting ready to leave town. It would have made for an excellent
          way to find victims without arousing suspicion. Additionally, Arthur
          took on his fathers duties as the town doctor, opening himself up to
          even more potential victims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once prohibition hit in 1919, he realized he had a great opportunity
          to bring a whole new generation of victims into the community. Because
          Arthur had so many underground tunnels, he set up a distillery in one
          of the basements of the hotel and became a booze-runner. Again he had
          an influx of desperate drifters who would show up and work for him. No
          matter how bad things got in the outside world, he always
          opportunities for murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1928, there was an explosion in one of his basement distilleries,
          which led to the discovery of over a dozen bodies. When authorities
          came to question Arthur, he was nowhere to be found. There was an
          exhaustive search, but it was concluded that he had somehow made a
          quick escape as soon as the explosion happened. There is another
          theory that Wilson was able to hide within the secret rooms and
          corridors of his hotel, waiting out the search party until he could
          make his escape.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Reverend Campbell Sutter, 1960-1965</h2>
        <p>
          After four decades away from sight, Arthur Wilson returns to the
          public eye in 1960 in a surprising way. A priest by the name of Arthur
          Sutter had started appearing in newspapers across the country, having
          formed a new Christian congregation known as the Church of the Eighth
          Sin. While he was based out of Chicago, Sutter traveled all over
          spreading his new doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to the budding civil rights movement, Sutter preached
          about the sin of Defiance. He said that those who are disobedient to
          their father are sinners. According to Sutter, engaging in defiance
          against authority was akin to spitting in Godâ€™s face.
        </p>
        <p>
          His following started small, but it grew substantially in 1964. Sutter
          called the ending of segregation an act of defiance against the
          established rules in the government, and was therefore a sin. He
          chastised flower children and environmentalists, building a group of
          followers who were strict and fervent believers in his extreme
          teachings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sutters movement was controversial, to say the least. After a civil
          rights protestor died during one of his traveling sermons in San Diego
          in January of 1965, Sutter revealed his grand plan to his followers.
          He proposed that he, and 100 of his most loyal followers would move to
          a remote location to start a new colony of true believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The followers, hand picked by Sutter, were not told where they would
          be moving. Only to pack a suitcase of their clothes. Most of these
          people would never be heard from again. Sutter moved his congregation
          into the Propitious Hotel. He claimed it was the perfect place for his
          congregation, because it was a ghost town where they would only need
          to follow the word of God, and his mouthpiece.
        </p>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s largely unknown what actually took place inside the hotel during
          this time. All recovered accounts come from a pair of former members
          who claimed to have escaped the hotel. In their story, Sutter had
          forced them into living like a cult-- he had extreme control over
          their eating and sleeping habits, often making them stay awake for
          upwards of 40 hours at a time. He would separate them frequently from
          each other, and force them to have one-on-one sessions with him.
          During these sessions, there were reports that Sutter knew things that
          people had only mentioned in private, which made him seem like he was
          more than just a man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their Church services were extreme, parishioners were forced to take
          LSD and other hallucinogens. While under the effects of these drugs,
          Sutter would apparently claim he was Arthur Wilson, and the devil gave
          him mind control powers that he would use to force them to do bizarre
          and horrible things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anonymous survivors said they fled in the middle of the night with
          a couple of bags filled with food and water, and walked for nearly a
          week through the California desert before they found a town. It was
          nearly another week before authorities actually inspected The
          Propitius, finding 99 dead bodies. They had all been gassed to death,
          including Arthur Sutter.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The Single Arthur Argument</h2>
        <p>
          There is no actual evidence that links Arthur Sutter to Arthur Wilson.
          Law enforcement has never been able to find any living or dead
          relatives of either persona to compare DNA to. However, that doesn't
          mean there isnâ€™t a substantial amount of circumstantial evidence
          linking the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they were on hallucinogenic drugs, the two escapees did claim
          that Arthur Sutter told them himself that he was Arthur Wilson.
        </p>
        <p>
          They both used the first name Arthur, and they both killed a lot of
          people in The Propitius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arthur Wilson was born in 1880, making him 85 when he returned to The
          Propitius. Arthur Sutter claimed to be 81, roughly the same age as
          Wilson would have been.
        </p>

        <p>
          This one I think comes the closest to being hard evidence. In the two
          photos below, youâ€™ll see a picture of Arthur Wilson and Arthur Sutter.
          In each picture they have what appears to be the same odd pendant.
          This detail was largely the basis for the demonic possession storyline
          in Murder Mansion, and does seem to be rather compelling.
